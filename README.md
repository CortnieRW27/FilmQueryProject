# FilmQueryProject



# Description
This project starts off by prompting a user to pick how they would like to look up a film, the user can either chose 1. to look up a film by the film id number, 2. look the film up by a key word, or 3. exit the program. If the user picks number one, they are then prompted to enter the id number of the film they would like to see. When the number is entered, the switch statement reads in the input and displays a movie that corresponds with that id number. Not only does the title of the film show up, but also the description of the film, the year the film was released, the rating, the language, and the list of actors that play in that film. If option two was chosen, the user is prompted to enter a key word, something like "amp" or "the", if any of the film titles or descriptions have the key word in them, the list of movies will be displayed. Option three is to simply exit the program. If a wrong id number is entered the user receives a message that there is no film to be returned with the given number. If a key word is entered that has no match with a title or description the user is shown a message that the key word has no match.

# Lessons Learned

I continue to learn so much throughout this program. I feel as though I am starting to gain much more comfortability with assignments, even if they seem to be a tall feat. I am learning how and where to find help when I am faced with challenges. I am improving in my ability to understand the syntax of Java more as well as learning the proper placement of “if statements” and “for/while loops”. Something that helped me extend my knowledge during this assignment was the logic that went into getting the films to only print once when being called with a key word. As I first started out, I would enter a key word and the film information would display for every actor in the film. I worked through how I could introduce logic into the method to get it to only display one time. My big take away from this road block was, learning how to use a variable to hold the information so that I could compare it to the next input and use an “if statement” to stop it from printing more than once. Some other things I learned this week and with this project were more practice with sql select statements and how they can help and hurt you! Over all, I would say this week has been very helpful in furthering my ability to understand, read, and write Java!
